              The Cannanes are a band that were initially formed in Chippendale,
              Sydney in 1984. Over the years they've grown a devoted fanbase -
              including a significant following overseas - and have released 9
              LPs and a dizzying number of cassettes, 7"s and EPs. They've had a
              fiercely DIY ethos, self-recording and releasing most of their
              music, but have also had labels of the likes of Chapter Music
              (Melbourne), 555 Recordings (Arizona), and Ajax Records (Chicago)
              championing their work.

              I was excited to chat to core members Fran Gibson and Stephen
              O'Neil about the history of The Cannanes, as well as their
              reflections on being an indie band that has eschewed most of the
              music industry's ways of working while watching Sydney and
              Australia change over the decades, as well as how it compares to
              their experiences overseas.

              The Cannanes are playing the Chapter Music 30th Birthday
              Celebration with Thibault at The Vic on the Park this Saturday the
              30th of July.

              To get going I'd love to chat about your last gig at the Golden
              Barley. Which if I understand correctly, was the first show in a
              fair while â€” like five or six years or something?
            </div>
            <div className={classes.text}>
              Fran Gibson: In Sydney, yeah. Two or three years since we'd
              played. We'd played in the US, done some other shows here and
              there. But Sydney, it had been a while.
